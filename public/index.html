Both\nAUD recordings suffered from btwn song pauses that not only\ncut the crowd cheer out but clipped the beginning of many\nsongs. The 2 AUD source coverage allowed my to patch 1 with\nthe other in some situations.  A couple spots I created a\nfake AUD recording by mixing crowd cheer with the SBD. This\nwas effective at creating patches for the rear channels in\nthe 5.1 presentation but also maintained a smooth quality in\nthe stereo matrix mix as well.  These patches are numerous\nand I think completely smooth and most likely undetectable.\n\nThe SBD+AUD matrix details.  The stereo matrix it is approx\n60% SBD, 20% Jerry Moore's AUD and 20% Steve Maizner's AUD.\nThe matrix mix on the center channel is a 50/50 with just\nthe SBD and Steve Maizner's AUD.  I also D'EQ'd both sources\nto pull up the vocals and give the center channel a unique\nsound as not to detract from the front stereo imaging or the\nrear surround effect. You will also note that the rear channels\nare just Jerry's AUD and not a matrix of the 2 AUD sources.  I\ndid give that configuration a listen but opted for the single\nrear source.  It was clearer and had more definition on its own.\n\nd1t01 The first 16.041 seconds of Minglewood blues was cut on\nthe SBD.  Starting this monster project with an unrecoverable\nflaw was unacceptable to me.  I decided to patch that opening\nportion with a SBD and AUD recording from 5-7-77.  As this\npatch ends you will hear some slight phasing as the stereo\nfield moves.  The result, although not perfect, I think\nprovides the listener with a more enjoyable and natural\nlistening experience.  Maybe you disagree.  For those of you\nwho would rather have a patch using a matrix mix of the 2 AUD\nsources please feel free to do it yourself :^)\n\nd1t07-08 The SBD is missing approx 34.361 from 42:47.001 -\n43:16.362.

It is unclear exactly \nwhat we have in the way of high resolution. However it seems \nthere is agreement that what we have cannot be represented \naccurately in 16/44. What you are getting is the full result \nof the matrix mix process. How much different does this sound? \nis this better? A little and yes. This is more accurate and \nhas more dynamic range.  24/96 resolution versus a 16/44 of \nthe same material will usually result in very subtle but \nimportant differences.  Most of it relying on the quality of\nthe DVD-A player and the D to A conversion.  With that in \nmind, this 24 bit copy is no different.  Small but important \ngains over the same material in 16/44.  This is just one \nman's take.  Take it or leave it.\n\nALLOT of editing was done to keep the flow btwn songs.

Design for use with a clear slim double jewel case.\n\nNotes: \n\nI looked at the 4 pages of notes I had on this project and it made me sick to think about typing them up.  So, although not complete, you will get a good idea of what was done to bring these recordings to this point.\n\nALLOT of editing was done to keep the flow btwn songs.  Both AUD recordings suffered from btwn song pauses that not only cut the crowd cheer out but clipped the beginning of many songs. The 2 AUD source coverage allowed my to patch 1 with the other in some situations.  A couple spots I created a fake AUD recording by mixing crowd cheer with the SBD. This was effective at creating patches for the rear channels in the 5.1 presentation but also maintained a smooth quality in the stereo matrix mix as well.  These patches are numerous and I think completely smooth and most likely undetectable.\n\nd1t01 The first 16.041 seconds of Minglewood blues was cut on the SBD.  Starting this monster project with an unrecoverable flaw was unacceptable to me.  I decided to patch that opening portion with a SBD and AUD recording from 5-7-77.  As this patch ends you will hear some slight phasing as the stereo field moves.  The result, although not perfect, I think provides the listener with a more enjoyable and natural listening experience.  Maybe you disagree.  For those of you who would rather have a patch using a matrix mix of the 2 AUD sources please feel free to do it yourself :^)\n\nd1t07-08 The SBD is missing approx 34.361 from 42:47.001 - 43:16.362.  This was patched using a matrix mix of the 2 AUD sources and then EQ'ed to best match the sound spectrum of the SBD.  I also tried to match the volume on the SBD.  A switch in sources is obvious to the listener but this is still pretty good.  The switch back to SBD is actually \nreally good as there are no vocals at that point.\n\nd2t02 A tiny right channel digital sizzle at 12:18.418. This was fixed using a quick channel swap.   This is smooth and most likely undetectable.\n\nIf you play this DTS-Audio-CD and hear static it is b/c you didn't really read the text file, did you?"],"runtime":[],"transferer":["Dan"],"taper":[],"lineage":[],"source":["Matrix - 3 Sources"],"coverage":["Ithaca, NY"],"venue":["Barton Hall, Cornell University"],"publicdate":["2005-06-23T18:38:54Z"],"pick":[],"subject":["Matrix","Dan"]},{"__v":2,"_day":"516bb8dc0ea9e4200ae60b89","_id":"515bd3dd284c0c00000001bb","_year":"515bd3bb18835e000000000d","album":"1977-05-08 - Barton Hall - Cornell University","date":"1977-05-08T04:00:00.000Z","day":8,"dir":"/7/items/gd1977-05-08.aud.moore.cribbs.28301.shnf","id":"gd1977-05-08.aud.moore.cribbs.28301.shnf","month":5,"server":"ia700208.us.archive.org","title":"Grateful Dead Live at Barton Hall - Cornell University on 1977-05-08","version":3,"year":1977,"total_reviews":6,"avg":4.6,"notes":["MAC>R>CD\nAudience Recording by Jerry Moore\n\nJerry: \"Lineage: Sony 153 master, w/ ECM 33P's, on Maxell UDXL-II's, Dolby B, copied via Teac AN-180 Dolby box onto Sony TC 755, Scotch Classic 10.5 inch reel, 7.5 ips, Dolby B - Transfer by Rob Berger (1/05), Sony TC 850>Teac AN-180>Sony SBM1 super bit mapper>Tascam CD-Rw4U.\n\nJust so, hopefully, nobody can misunderstand what they got: Came off my cassette master, except for Scarlet/Fire, on which my master had speed fluctuations.
