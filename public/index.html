The result is a tone which hovers around 8000 Hz with an amplitude of about +20 dB above the noise floor. This translate to a very annoying pitch, especially during quiet sections, which is in the old-tv-tube or lousy-hard-disk or maybe even the-sound-you-hear-after-you-slam-your-head-against-a-concrete-wall class of 'whine'. Because this interference is 'monochromatic' it's easy to get rid of if you have the processing power and a quick FFT algorithm. I used the filter-shaping capabilities of the Sonic Foundry Noise Reduction Plugin to tailor a very narrow notch filter which attenuated the interference without affecting the rest of the signal. And it's all done in the digital domain. Huzzah!\n\nAs a side note, I actually ended up crafting many filters to process these shows. The frequency of the interference actually drifted anywhere from 7700 to 8100 Hz during a given show. This was probalby due to a slightly wandering reel speed. It made my work harder but when I tried a much wider filter I started to be able to hear the attenuation in the music. The filters generally go like this (see info file for diagram).\n\nThe end result is no more annoying whine! \n\nI also removed some of the nasty mic feedback in the 2/18/71 Bertha using this type of filter."],"runtime":[],"transferer":["Leigh Orf"],"taper":[],"lineage":["SBD > Dolby A Reel > Dolby A decode > DAT > Sound Forge NR > CD-R > SHN"],"source":["Soundboard (remastered)"],"coverage":["Port Chester, NY"],"venue":["Capitol Theater"],"publicdate":["2004-06-03T04:49:51Z"],"pick":[],"subject":["Soundboard","Leigh Orf"]},{"__v":2,"_day":"516bb8dd0ea9e4200ae60d78","_id":"515bd3e4284c0c0000000b94","_year":"515bd3bb18835e0000000007","album":"1971-02-18 - Capitol Theater","date":"1971-02-18T05:00:00.000Z","day":18,"dir":"/35/items/gd1971-02-18.sbd.miller.111793.flac16","id":"gd1971-02-18.sbd.miller.111793.flac16","month":2,"server":"ia700402.us.archive.org","title":"Grateful Dead Live at Capitol Theater on 1971-02-18","version":3,"year":1971,"total_reviews":16,"avg":4.44,"notes":["Notes:\n-- This is a huge upgrade to all previously circulating sources\n-- This is not from the same betty board reels that have circulated since 1986\n-- Thanks to David Gans for lending me his Dats\n-- Thanks to Joe B.
