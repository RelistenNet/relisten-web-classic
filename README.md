# Relisten.net

This is the code that powers [relisten.net](http://relisten.net), a completely free live music streaming service utilizing the music of [Archive.org](http://archive.org) and [Phish.in](http://phish.in). The backend is powered by [Alec Gorge](https://twitter.com/alecgorge)'s [Iguana](https://github.com/alecgorge/iguana).

## Warning

This code was written several years ago when I was in college and has remained relatively untouched since. It was not intended to be open sourced, but I can not come up with a single valid reason why it should not be. Peruse the source at your own risk [or mine?].

## Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to this project, whether it be by opening an issue or sending a pull request. The code is, at times, messy. Feel free to reach out with questions or comments and I'll do my best to answer them.

## Running

```
$ npm install
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ grunt watch
$ node server.js # in a new shell
